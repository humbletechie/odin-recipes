        <p>Gnocchi is simple to make with just three ingredients: mashed potato, flour, and egg. 
        This recipe is one my family has used for generations.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h4>

            <li>2 potatoes,peeled</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h5>

            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.

                Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.
